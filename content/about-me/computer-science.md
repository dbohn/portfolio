As a teenager I developed a large interest for the inner workings of computers and the algorithms behind them.
So it was a no-brainer to study computer science to further extend my capabilities in logical thinking and
problem solved. I began my studies at the "Freie Universit√§t Berlin" in Winter 2012 and reached the bachelor degree
in early 2016 with a thesis on the topic of information dissemination in wireless sensor networks using gossiping-based algorithms.

Afterwards I enrolled in a master program and am now working on my final master thesis.
Throughout the study I additionally engaged in further extending my horizon and got into the development of web applications and APIs
with the Laravel Framework, Vue.js and other modern web technologies and am also proficient in working with Java applications and microcontroller development.
