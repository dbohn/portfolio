I'm not only studying computer science, I'm also hugely interested in
the results of the ongoing developments of the industry.
I'm very much into the topic of the Internet of Things and the possibilities
it provides, but am also aware of the problems surrounding this topic,
such as the unsatisfactory security of many of these projects.
In my opinion, it is not only important to see what's the latest and greatest
but also use my own experiences with this technology to question its information
security, its usefulness and its social impact as well.
