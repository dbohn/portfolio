Music has been a part of my whole life. By learning an instrument from a very young age up until today,
I developed a habit of working hard to achieve the best possible result for any task.

As I started to get into computer science, I soon noticed the artistical aspects of developing IT solutions.
You have to enforce creative thinking and you have to strive for the difference to create something new. That's why I put this as a top priority for my work.
